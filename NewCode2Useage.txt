[--n_neurons N_NEURONS] Number of neurons used in excitory/inhibitory layer *1
[--n_train N_TRAIN] Number of sample data
[--n_test N_TEST] Number of test data
[--update interval UPDATE_INTERVAL] Update temporary labels for excitory neurons after given interval data.
[--gpu] use gpu (default set to false)




*1  As written on paper, the 28x28 image is encoded into spikes and sent to all excitory neurons, those are connected to same number
of inhibitory neurons.

Example: python .\newcode2.py --n_train 330 --n_test 100 --gpu --update_interval 20 --n_neuron 6400

All activity accuracy:
0.3
Proportion weighting accuracy:
0.31


This is unsupervised learning. The labels are assigned after training is done. 

All activity accuracy:
This method is to assign label to neuron that generate most spikes for.
In test phase, the lable with highest appearance among the firing neurons is chosen. 

Proportion weighting accuracy:
This method is to give neuron proportions of spike activity per class.
In test phase, the proportions of labels among the firing neurons is added. The label with highest sum is chosen.
